# PHP-Mailer
Simple PHP mailing application to send emails via gmail.

PHP Mailer on Windows 10 using your localhost on an Apache server.

PHPMailer is available on Packagist (using semantic versioning), and installation via Composer is the recommended way to install PHPMailer

Create a new project file

Run composer to generater libraries in new project file:

composer require phpmailer/phpmailer


If you don't have composer. Download composer at https://getcomposer.org/ 
Use the excutable to setup the environment variables automatically. Otherwise you can manually add your bin path to the environment 
variables in Control panel>System>Advanced System Settings environment variables...

Composer will generate all the necessary libaries.
NOTE that the vendor folder and the vendor/autoload.php script are generated by Composer; 
they are not part of PHPMailer as seen in the github: PHPMailer. 
Highly recommend composer.

Add the php file I have written to the new project file. Change the details of yours and the reciepents emails.

Go into your gmail account>security settings and at the bottom of the page set "Less secure app access" to ON. This way, your application
can log into your gmail account.

Using a running Apache server, run the file in your browser localhost/new project file/send-email.php
